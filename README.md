# PicoIDE

Script for faster and easier development in *nix shell.

To use this script, you need to install compiler and text editor. (g++ and vim, for example).

### Installation 

* How do i install it?

To install PicoIDE, you need any c++ compiler to be installed. Google "g++ installation <YOUR LINUX DISTRO>" for help.

After that, download archive, and extract it into any folder.

When the archive extracted, enter into folder with extracted files and compile "installer.cpp", and then execute compiled file.

Follow the intructions on screen. 

Finally, you have installed PicoIDE. Congrats! Now yo can remove installer.cpp and do_not_rename_me.cpp.

To run PicoIDE, just type ./picoide.

Have fun!

### Questions

* I want to use PicoIDE on Windows/DOS, can i do this?
  * No, you can't unless you optimize script for windows command shell (For example, to clear screen in linux, you need to type "clear", but in windows you need to type "cls")

* Can I use PicoIDE on my Slackware/FreeBSD/Debian/Gentoo/OSX/Pidora/etc?
  * You can use it everywhere, where the linux kernel is installed(even on Android, but for that you need to install compiler, text editor, and busybox)
  
* Where can I need PicoIDE?
  * As it uses CLI, you will have better performance on slower devices, such as Raspberry Pi Model A. Also, somebody prefer to use CLI instead of X11 IDEs.
  
* Can i use PicoIDE to compile Pascal/C/Java/Assembly/etc.
 * Yes, you can, but you need to modify some lines of code, which used to execute and compile programms.
